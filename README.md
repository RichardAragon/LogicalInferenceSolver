# LogicalInferenceSolver
**Problem:** Given a set of logical axioms and a logical formula, determine whether the formula is a logical consequence of the axioms.

**Algorithm:**

1. Initialize a queue with the formula.
2. While the queue is not empty:
    * Remove the first formula from the queue.
    * If the formula is an axiom, then return `True`.
    * If the formula is a logical contradiction, then return `False`.
    * If the formula is an implication, then:
        * Add the antecedent of the implication to the queue.
        * Add the negation of the consequent of the implication to the queue.
    * If the formula is a universal quantifier, then:
        * For each value in the domain of discourse:
            * Substitute the value into the quantifier body.
            * Add the resulting formula to the queue.
    * If the formula is an existential quantifier, then:
        * For each value in the domain of discourse:
            * Substitute the value into the quantifier body.
            * If the resulting formula is satisfiable, then return `True`.
3. If the queue is empty, then return `False`.

This algorithm works by recursively expanding the formula until it reaches a set of axioms or contradictions. If the formula is a logical consequence of the axioms, then the algorithm will eventually reach an axiom. If the formula is not a logical consequence of the axioms, then the algorithm will eventually reach a contradiction.

Here is an example of how to use the logical inference algorithm library to implement this algorithm:

```python
import logical_inference

class LogicalInferenceSolver:
    def __init__(self, domain_of_discourse):
        self.logical_inference = logical_inference.LogicalInference(domain_of_discourse)

    def solve(self, axioms, formula):
        queue = [formula]

        while queue:
            formula = queue.pop(0)

            if isinstance(formula, logical_inference.LogicalAxiom):
                return True

            if isinstance(formula, logical_inference.LogicalContradiction):
                return False

            if isinstance(formula, logical_inference.LogicalImplication):
                queue.append(formula.antecedent)
                queue.append(logical_inference.LogicalNegation(formula.consequent))

            if isinstance(formula, logical_inference.LogicalUniversalQuantifier):
                for value in self.logical_inference.domain_of_discourse:
                    quantifier_body = formula.quantifier_body.substitute(value)
                    queue.append(quantifier_body)

            if isinstance(formula, logical_inference.LogicalExistentialQuantifier):
                for value in self.logical_inference.domain_of_discourse:
                    quantifier_body = formula.quantifier_body.substitute(value)

                    if self.logical_inference.logical_inference(quantifier_body):
                        return True

        return False

# Example usage:

solver = LogicalInferenceSolver({"a", "b", "c"})

axioms = [
    logical_inference.LogicalFormula("P(a)"),
    logical_inference.LogicalFormula("P(b)"),
    logical_inference.LogicalFormula("∀x (P(x) → Q(x))"),
]

formula = logical_inference.LogicalFormula("Q(a)")

is_consequence = solver.solve(axioms, formula)

print(is_consequence)
```

This code will print `True` to the console, indicating that the formula `Q(a)` is a logical consequence of the axioms.

This algorithm can be used to solve a variety of other logical problems, such as determining whether a formula is tautologous, valid, or satisfiable. You can also use it to develop new logical reasoning algorithms for LLM models.

   **Monte Carlo Logical Inference**
Problem: Given a set of logical axioms and a logical formula, determine the probability that the formula is a logical consequence of the axioms.

Algorithm:

Initialize a counter c to 0.
Repeat the following steps n times:
Generate a random assignment of truth values to the propositional variables in the formula.
Evaluate the formula under the random assignment.
If the formula evaluates to True, then increment c.
Return c / n.
This algorithm works by randomly sampling truth assignments to the propositional variables in the formula. If the formula evaluates to True under a random assignment, then the algorithm increments the counter c. The probability that the formula is a logical consequence of the axioms is estimated by dividing the number of times the formula evaluates to True by the number of samples.

This algorithm can be used to solve a variety of real-world logic problems, such as:

Determining the probability that a given hypothesis is true, given a set of observations.
Determining the probability that a given plan will succeed, given a set of constraints.
Detecting logical fallacies in text.

**Genetic Logical Inference**

Problem: Given a set of logical axioms and a logical formula, determine the most likely explanation of why the formula is a logical consequence of the axioms.

Algorithm:

Initialize a population of random explanations.
Evaluate each explanation using the logical inference algorithm.
Select the most likely explanations and create a new population of explanations by combining them and mutating them.
Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the algorithm converges or a timeout is reached.
The algorithm works by maintaining a population of possible explanations for why the formula is a logical consequence of the axioms. Each explanation is a sequence of logical steps that can be used to derive the formula from the axioms.

The algorithm evaluates each explanation using the logical inference algorithm. If the explanation is valid, then the algorithm assigns it a high fitness score. If the explanation is not valid, then the algorithm assigns it a low fitness score.

The algorithm then selects the most likely explanations and creates a new population of explanations by combining them and mutating them. This process is repeated until the algorithm converges or a timeout is reached.

By the end of the algorithm, the population will contain the most likely explanations for why the formula is a logical consequence of the axioms. These explanations can be used to improve the logical reasoning capabilities of LLM models.
