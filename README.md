# LogicalInferenceSolver
**Problem:** Given a set of logical axioms and a logical formula, determine whether the formula is a logical consequence of the axioms.

**Algorithm:**

1. Initialize a queue with the formula.
2. While the queue is not empty:
    * Remove the first formula from the queue.
    * If the formula is an axiom, then return `True`.
    * If the formula is a logical contradiction, then return `False`.
    * If the formula is an implication, then:
        * Add the antecedent of the implication to the queue.
        * Add the negation of the consequent of the implication to the queue.
    * If the formula is a universal quantifier, then:
        * For each value in the domain of discourse:
            * Substitute the value into the quantifier body.
            * Add the resulting formula to the queue.
    * If the formula is an existential quantifier, then:
        * For each value in the domain of discourse:
            * Substitute the value into the quantifier body.
            * If the resulting formula is satisfiable, then return `True`.
3. If the queue is empty, then return `False`.

This algorithm works by recursively expanding the formula until it reaches a set of axioms or contradictions. If the formula is a logical consequence of the axioms, then the algorithm will eventually reach an axiom. If the formula is not a logical consequence of the axioms, then the algorithm will eventually reach a contradiction.

Here is an example of how to use the logical inference algorithm library to implement this algorithm:

```python
import logical_inference

class LogicalInferenceSolver:
    def __init__(self, domain_of_discourse):
        self.logical_inference = logical_inference.LogicalInference(domain_of_discourse)

    def solve(self, axioms, formula):
        queue = [formula]

        while queue:
            formula = queue.pop(0)

            if isinstance(formula, logical_inference.LogicalAxiom):
                return True

            if isinstance(formula, logical_inference.LogicalContradiction):
                return False

            if isinstance(formula, logical_inference.LogicalImplication):
                queue.append(formula.antecedent)
                queue.append(logical_inference.LogicalNegation(formula.consequent))

            if isinstance(formula, logical_inference.LogicalUniversalQuantifier):
                for value in self.logical_inference.domain_of_discourse:
                    quantifier_body = formula.quantifier_body.substitute(value)
                    queue.append(quantifier_body)

            if isinstance(formula, logical_inference.LogicalExistentialQuantifier):
                for value in self.logical_inference.domain_of_discourse:
                    quantifier_body = formula.quantifier_body.substitute(value)

                    if self.logical_inference.logical_inference(quantifier_body):
                        return True

        return False

# Example usage:

solver = LogicalInferenceSolver({"a", "b", "c"})

axioms = [
    logical_inference.LogicalFormula("P(a)"),
    logical_inference.LogicalFormula("P(b)"),
    logical_inference.LogicalFormula("∀x (P(x) → Q(x))"),
]

formula = logical_inference.LogicalFormula("Q(a)")

is_consequence = solver.solve(axioms, formula)

print(is_consequence)
```

This code will print `True` to the console, indicating that the formula `Q(a)` is a logical consequence of the axioms.

This algorithm can be used to solve a variety of other logical problems, such as determining whether a formula is tautologous, valid, or satisfiable. You can also use it to develop new logical reasoning algorithms for LLM models.
